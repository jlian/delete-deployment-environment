# delete-deployment-environment

GitHub action that will find and delete all deployments by deployment name as well as the GitHub environment
they are deployed to.
It will first find and mark all deployments as `inactive` and then delete all deployments and then the environment.

If you want to only delete deployments and the not environment, add `onlyRemoveDeployments: true`.

If you want to keep deployments but inactivate all deployments, add `onlyDeactivateDeployments: true`

If you want to only delete a deployment ref and not all deployments of a given environment, add `ref: my-branch`

Note if you pass `onlyDeactivateDeployments: true` and `onlyRemoveDeployments: true`, `onlyRemoveDeployments` will override
`onlyDeactivateDeployments` and all deployments will be removed.

Also note that if you are planning on deleting a created environment, your `GITHUB_TOKEN` must have permissions with repo scope. The token provided by the workflow, `github.token` does not have the permissions to delete created environments.
